# What file has to be modified to make it permanent?

/etc/hosts
/etc/hostname

# You can easily do this with
sudo vi /etc/hostname
# then change hosts file to edit the IP to hostname mapping
sudo vi /etc/hosts
# then finally the system needs to be rebooted

# In newer versions you can set the hostname with single command
hostnamectl set-hostname new-name-here
